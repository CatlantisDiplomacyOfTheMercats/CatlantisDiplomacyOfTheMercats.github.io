# Catlantis Enhanced

## Diplomacy Missions
Using a team of your currently owned cats, you may (once per turn) form a team of UP TO 5 mercats (*diplomats*) to set out
on a diplomacy mission with a random *tribe* of mercats.

The player draws cards until they get 5 mercats to form the *tribe*, placing any treasures drawn
into the *redraw pile* to be shuffled in again in the future.

When the *tribe* is formed, a diplomacy agreement is attempted. If the player's *diplomats*
Fur Orders match a majority of the *tribe's* Fur Orders, a **GEM** is obtained. Further, if
this Fur Order majority is met, if a majority of Fin Family is also met, another **GEM** is obtained.
*(If the Fur Order is NOT met, but the Fin Family IS MET, no gems are obtained regardless)*

On a successful mission (1+ **GEMS** obtained), the *tribe* is placed into the
*Mercenary Shop*, placing any cards previously in the *Mercenary Shop* into the *redraw pile*.

Whether the mission is successful or not, the mercats the player used are placed in their
*nap zone*, where they still count for scoring but may no longer be used for further
diplomacy missions.

## Shop system

### Mercenary Shop
At the beginning of the game, draw 5 of the top cards in the deck and place them,
face up, in a row. This begins the *mercenary shop*, wherein a player may trade 1 **GEM**
for any **2** cards in this shop. This shop is replenished and replaced after each diplomacy mission.

### Fin Family/Fur Order Alliances
While the Fin Family and Fur Orders are distributed at the beginning as normal, any remaining
are placed into the *Treaty Shop*, face-down. A player is able to form a treaty
with a Fin Family or Fur Order by paying 3 **GEMS**. When this is done, the
player is allowed to take the **TOP** card from the respective pile, WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT, and claiming it as an alliance.

All alliances are then revealed at the **END OF THE GAME**, wherein they are scored alongside the player's original
Fin Family and Fur Order.

### Treasure Stash
At any point in a player's turn, they may **SELL** 4 pieces of treasure into the *treasure shop*
in exchange for 1 **GEM**.
*(Coins' values are equivalent to a corresponding amount of treasure, e.g. the
2-point coin is worth 2 pieces of treasure)*

Similarly, at any point in a player's turn, they may **BUY** 2 pieces of treasure from the *treasure shop*
in exchange for 1 **GEM**.

## Scoring
Base game scoring is similar:
- For ***each*** Fin Family and Fur Order owned, you use the tier-based point system based on the mercats you own
- For treasures (in 2-player mode): 4 points to the person with the most, 1
  point to everyone that owns at least one, 0 points to anyone without the treasure
- Coins are worth the same
